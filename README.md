- Detected and corrected data types using the Auto Detect function.

### 3. Data Processing
- Created a new column, **"AttritionCount"**, using the Conditional Column feature (`IF Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0`).
- Created measures using DAX queries:
  - **Attrition Rate** = `(SUM([AttritionCount])/SUM([EmployeeCount])) * 100`
- Used these metrics to create various KPIs and charts.

### 4. Data Analysis
- Designed visualizations like bar charts, KPIs, tables, pie charts, and more to present data in a clear and interactive format.
